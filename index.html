      <h1>Who is Toussaint Louverture?</h1>

      <p>
        François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture also known as Toussaint L'Ouverture
        or Toussaint Bréda; 20 May 1743 was a Haitian general and the most prominent leader of the Haitian
        Revolution. During his life, Louverture first fought against the French, then for them, and then finally against
        France
        again for the cause of Haitian independence. As a revolutionary leader, Louverture displayed military and
        political
        acumen that helped transform the fledgling slave rebellion into a revolutionary movement. Louverture is now
        known as the
        "Father of Haiti".
      </p>

      <p>
        Louverture was born enslaved on the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now known as Haiti. He was a devout
        Catholic who
        became a freeman before the revolution and, once freed, identified as a Frenchman for the greater part of his
        life.
        During his time as a freeman he attempted to climb the highly stratified social ladder on the island, gaining
        and losing
        much wealth while working as a planter, slave owner, coachman, muleteer and miller across several plantations.
        At the
        start of the Haitian revolution he was nearly 50 years old and began his military career as a lieutenant to
        Biassou, an
        early leader of the 1791 War for Freedom in Saint-Domingue.[3] Initially allied with the Spaniards of
        neighboring Santo
        Domingo, Louverture switched his allegiance to the French when the new Republican government abolished slavery.
        Louverture gradually established control over the whole island and used his political and military influence to
        gain
        dominance over his rivals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout his years in power, he worked to balance the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about
        the
        economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labor; negotiated trade agreements with
        the
        United Kingdom and the United States and maintained a large and well-trained army.[5] Although Louverture did
        not sever
        ties with France in 1800 after defeating rival leaders among the Haitian revolutionary population, he
        promulgated an
        autonomous constitution for the colony in 1801 that named him as Governor-General for Life, even against
        Napoleon
        Bonaparte's wishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1802, he was invited to a parley by French Divisional General Jean-Baptiste Brunet, but was arrested upon his
        arrival. He was deported to France and jailed at the Fort de Joux. He died in 1803. Although Louverture died
        before the
        final and most violent stage of the Haitian Revolution, his achievements set the grounds for the Haitian army's
        final
        victory. Suffering massive losses in multiple battles at the hands of the Haitian army and losing thousands of
        men to
        yellow fever, the French capitulated and withdrew permanently from Saint-Domingue the very same year. The
        Haitian
        Revolution continued under Louverture's lieutenant, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who declared independence on 1
        January
        1804, thereby establishing the sovereign state of Haiti.
      </p>


      <h1>Birth, parentage, and childhood</h1>
      <p>
        Louverture was born into slavery, the eldest son of Hyppolite, an Allada slave from the slave coast of West
        Africa, and
        his second wife Pauline, a slave from the Aja ethnic group, and given the name Toussaint at birth.[4]
        Louverture's son
        Issac would later name his great-grandfather, Hyppolite's father, as Gaou Guinou and a son of the King of
        Allada,
        however there is little extant evidence of this. The name Gaou possibly originated in the title Deguenon,
        meaning "old
        man" or "wise man" in the Allada kingdom, making Gaou Guinou and his son Hyppolite members of the bureaucracy or
        nobility, but not members of the royal family. In Africa, Hyppolite and his first wife, Catherine, were forced
        into
        slavery due to a series of imperialist wars of expansion by the Kingdom of Dahomey into the Allada territory. In
        order
        to remove their political rivals and obtain European trade goods Dahomean slavers separated the couple and sold
        them to
        the crew of the French slave ship the Hermione, which then headed to the sugar plantations of the Caribbean. The
        original names of Toussaint's parents are unknown as French colonial law mandated that slaves brought to their
        colonies
        be made into Catholics, stripped of their African names, and be given more European names in order to assimilate
        them
        into the French plantation system. Toussaint's father received the name Hyppolite upon his baptism on
        Saint-Domingue as
        Latin and Greek names were the most fashionable for slaves at this time, followed by French, and Biblical
        Christian
        names.
      </p>


      <p>
        Louverture is thought to have been born on the plantation of Bréda at Haut de Cap in Saint-Domingue, where his
        parents
        were enslaved and where he would spend the majority of his life before the revolution.[7][8] His parents would
        go on to
        have several children after him, with five going on to surviving infancy; Marie-Jean, Paul, Pierre, Jean, and
        Gaou,
        named for his grandfather. Louverture would grow closest to his younger brother Paul, who along with his other
        siblings
        were baptized into the Catholic Church by the local Jesuit Order. Pierre-Baptiste Simon, a carpenter and
        gatekeeper on
        the Bréda plantation, is considered to have been Louverture's godfather and would go on to become a parental
        figure to
        Louverture's family along with his foster mother Pelage after the passing of Toussaint's parents.[9] Growing up,
        Toussaint would first learn to speak the African Fon language of the Allada slaves on the plantation, then the
        Haitian
        Kreyòl of the greater colony, and eventually the Standard French of the French elite during the revolution.
      </p>


      <p>
        Although he would later become known for his stamina and riding prowess, Louverture earned the nickname
        Fatras-Bâton
        ("sickly stick"), in reference to his small thin stature in his youth.[10][11]: 26–27  Toussaint and his
        siblings would
        go on to be trained as domestic servants with Louverture being trained as an equestrian and coachmen after
        showing a
        talent for handling the horses and oxen on the plantation. This allowed the siblings to work in the manor house
        and
        stables, away from the grueling physical labor and deadly corporal punishment meted out in the sugar cane
        fields. In
        spite of this relative privilege, there is evidence that even in his youth Louverture's pride pushed him to
        engage in
        fights with members of the Petits-blancs (white commoner) community, who worked on the plantation as hired help.
        There
        is a record that Louverture beat a young petit blanc named Ferere, but was able to escape punishment after being
        protected by the new plantation overseer, François Antoine Bayon de Libertat. De Libertat had become steward of
        the
        Bréda property after it was inherited by Pantaléon de Bréda Jr., a grand blanc (white noblemen), and managed by
        Bréda's
        nephew the Count of Noah.[12] In spite or perhaps because of this protection, Louverture went on to engage in
        other
        fights. One time he threw the plantation attorney Bergé off a horse, belonging to the Bréda plantation, when he
        attempted to take it outside the bounds of the property without permission.
      </p>


      <h1>education</h1>
      <p>
        Louverture gained some education from his godfather Pierre-Baptiste on the Bréda plantation.[18] His extant
        letters
        demonstrate a moderate familiarity with Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher who had lived as a slave, while his
        public
        speeches showed a familiarity with Machiavelli.[19] Some cite Enlightenment thinker Abbé Raynal, a French critic
        of
        slavery, and his publication Histoire des deux Indes predicting a slave revolt in the West Indies as a possible
        influence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Louverture received a degree of theological education from the Jesuit and Capuchin missionaries through his
        church
        attendance and devout Catholicism. His medical knowledge is attributed to a familiarity with the folk medicine
        of the
        African plantation slaves and Creole communities, as well as more formal techniques found in the hospitals
        founded by
        the Jesuits and the free people of color.[22] Legal documents signed on Louverture's behalf between 1778–1781
        suggest
        that he could not yet write at that time.[23][13]: 61–67  Throughout his military and political career during
        the
        revolution, he was known to have verbally dictated his letters to his secretaries, who prepared most of his
        correspondences. A few surviving documents from the end of his life in his own hand confirm that he eventually
        learned
        to write, although his Standard French spelling was "strictly phonetic" and closer to the Haitian Kreyòl he
        spoke for
        the majority of his life.
      </p>

      <h1>Beginnings of a rebellion: 1789–1793</h1>
      <p>
        Beginning in 1789, the black and mixed-race population of Saint-Domingue became inspired by a multitude of
        factors that
        converged on the island in the late 1780s and early 1790s leading to them organize a series of rebellions
        against the
        central white colonial assembly in Le Cap. In 1789 two mix-race Creole merchants, Vincent Ogé and Julien
        Raimond,
        happened to be in France during the early stages of the French Revolution. Here they began lobbying the French
        National
        Assembly to expand voting rights and legal protections from the grands blancs to the wealthy slaving owning gens
        de
        couleur, such as themselves. Being of majority white descent and with Ogé having been educated in France, the
        two were
        incensed that their black African ancestry prevented them from having the same legal rights as their fathers,
        who were
        both grand blanc planters. Rebuffed by the assembly they return to the colony where Ogé met up with
        Jean-Baptiste
        Chavannes, a wealthy mixed-race veteran of the American Revolution and an abolitionist. Here the two organized a
        small
        scale revolt in 1790 composed of a few hundred gens de couleur, who engaged in several battles against the
        colonial
        militias on the island. However, after the movement failed to gain traction Ogé and Chavannes were quickly
        captured and
        publicly broken on the wheel in the public square in Le Cap in February 1791. For the slaves on the island
        worsening
        conditions due to the neglect of legal protections afforded them by the Code Noir stirred animosities and made a
        revolt
        more attractive compared to the continued exploitation by the grands and petits blancs. Then the political and
        social
        disability caused by the French Revolution's attempt to expand the rights to all men, inspired a series of
        revolts
        across several neighboring French possessions in the Caribbean, which upset much of the established trade
        between the
        colonies. Many of the devout Catholic slaves and freedmen, including Toussaint, identified as free Frenchmen and
        royalists, who desired to protect a series of progressive legal protections afforded to the black citizenry by
        King
        Louis XVI and his predecessors.
      </p>


      <p>
        On August 14, 1791, two hundred members of the black and mixed-race population made up of slave foremen,
        Creoles, and
        freed slaves gathered in secret at a plantation in Morne-Rouge in the north of Saint-Domingue to plan their
        revolt. Here
        prominent early figures of the revolution such as Dutty François Boukman, Jean-François Papillon, Georges
        Biassou,
        Jeannot Bullet, and Toussaint gathered to nominate a single leader to guide the revolt. Toussaint, wary of the
        dangers
        of taking on such a public role, especially after hearing about what happened to Ogé and Chavannes, went on to
        nominate
        Georges Biassou as leader. He would later join his forces as a secretary and lieutenant, and be in command of a
        small
        detachment of soldiers.[25][26] During this time Toussaint took up the name of Monsieur Toussaint, a title that
        was once
        been reserved for the white population of Saint-Domingue. Surviving documents show him participating in the
        leadership
        of the rebellion, discussing strategy, and negotiating with the Spanish supporters of the rebellion for
        supplies.
        Wanting to identify with the royalist cause Louverture and other rebels wore white cockades upon their sleeves
        and
        crosses of St. Louis.
      </p>

      <h1>Alliance with the Spanish: 1793–1794</h1>
      <p>
        Despite adhering to royalist views, Louverture began to use the language of freedom and equality associated with
        the
        French Revolution.[35] From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had
        become
        committed to its complete abolition.[36][37] After an offer of land, privileges, and recognizing the freedom of
        slave
        soldiers and their families, Jean-François and Biassou formally allied with the Spanish in May 1793; Louverture
        likely
        did so in early June. He had made covert overtures to General Laveaux prior but was rebuffed as Louverture's
        conditions
        for alliance were deemed unacceptable. At this time the republicans were yet to make any formal offer to the
        slaves in
        arms and conditions for the blacks under the Spanish looked better than that of the French.[38] In response to
        the civil
        commissioners' radical 20 June proclamation (not a general emancipation, but an offer of freedom to male slaves
        who
        agreed to fight for them) Louverture stated that "the blacks wanted to serve under a king and the Spanish king
        offered
        his protection."[39]
      </p>

      <p>
        On 29 August 1793 he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the black population of St. Domingue:

        Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken
        vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St. Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite
        yourselves to
        us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.[20]

        On the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, proclaimed emancipation for all
        slaves
        in French Saint-Domingue,[40] hoping to bring the black troops over to his side.[41] Initially, this failed,
        perhaps
        because Louverture and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority.[42]

        However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government in France proclaimed the abolition of
        slavery.[43] For
        months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general Étienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de
        Laveaux.
        During this time, his competition with the other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look
        with
        disfavor on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.
      </p>

      <h1>Alliance with the French: 1794–1796</h1>
      <p>
        The timing of and motivation behind Louverture's volte-face against Spain remains debated amongst historians.
        James
        claimed that upon learning of the emancipation decree in May 1794, Louverture decided to join the French in
        June.[51] It
        is argued by Ardouin that Toussaint was indifferent toward black freedom, concerned primarily for his own safety
        and
        resentful over his treatment by the Spanish – leading him to officially join the French 4 May 1794 when he
        raised the
        republican flag over Gonaïves.[52] Ott sees Louverture as "both a power-seeker and sincere abolitionist" who was
        working
        with Laveaux since January 1794 and switched sides 6 May.
      </p>


      <p>
        Afterward, Louverture claimed to have switched sides after emancipation was proclaimed and the commissioners
        Sonthonax
        and Polverel had returned to France in June 1794. However, a letter from Toussaint to General Laveaux confirms
        that he
        was already fighting officially on the behalf of the French by 18 May 1794.
      </p>



      <p>In the first weeks, Louverture eradicated all Spanish supporters from the Cordon de l'Ouest, which he had held
        on their
        behalf.[55] He faced attack from multiple sides. His former colleagues in the slave rebellion were now fighting
        against
        him for the Spanish. As a French commander, he was faced with British troops who had landed on Saint-Domingue in
        September, as the British hoped to take advantage of the ongoing instability to capture the prosperous
        island.[56] Henry
        Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who was Secretary of State for War for British prime minister William Pitt the
        Younger,
        instructed Sir Adam Williamson, the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, to sign an agreement with representatives of
        the
        French colonists that promised to restore the ancien regime, slavery and discrimination against mixed-race
        colonists, a
        move that drew criticism from abolitionists William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson.

        On the other hand, Louverture was able to pool his 4,000 men with Laveaux's troops in joint actions.[59] By now
        his
        officers included men who were to remain important throughout the revolution: his brother Paul, his nephew
        Moïse,
        Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and Henri Christophe.</p>
